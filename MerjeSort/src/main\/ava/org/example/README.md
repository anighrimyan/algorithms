Merge Sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is implemented in Java using the MergeSort class. This algorithm sorts an array of integers in ascending order by recursively dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half separately, and then merging the sorted halves back together.

Usage
To use the Merge Sort algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the MergeSort class.
2. Call the mergeSort method of the MergeSort instance, passing the array, the starting index, and the ending index of the range to be sorted.
